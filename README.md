Hello all,

This is my non-personal account for github, where I'm not focused
on finding a job and more focused on having fun and persuing my hobbies.

I'm here mainly to learn, grow, and share my work with others.
As I get better, I hope to create viable tools for others to use.
My work will mostly be in the information security and networking
realm, but I am also passionate about the environment and as of 
this moment I am currently working on programming embedded systems 
for a hydropontics side project of mine.

I am a big advocate for open source, so any code I write is free
to use. I'm happy if you're happy. If you want to support me,
I'll link a place for crypto donations sometime in the future.

If you want to reach out, my email is suneyh@protonmail.com.
